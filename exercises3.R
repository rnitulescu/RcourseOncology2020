## Part I: In-class problems (solutions available)

## Problem 1: Plot the power as a function of sample size for the following study design:
##            - Normally distributed outcome
##            - Two independent samples of the same size
##            - Compared with a Student's t-test
##            - Cohen's d is given below
d <- 0.8

## Problem 2: Write a script that performs randomization by permuted blocks,
##            but where block size is also randomized.
##            Check that treatment allocation is balanced.

## Problem 3: Write a script that performs randomization by permuted blocks,
##            but where there is stratification by sex (i.e., male and female)
##            Check that treatment allocation is balanced for both males and females.
